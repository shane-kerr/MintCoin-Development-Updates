# MintCoin Development Update 2018-08-07

It's been a long, hot summer in the northern hemisphere. Things look
like they may finally be starting to cool off, which means time to
stop gulping down mint juleps and start working on MintCoin.

# MintCoin 2.1 RC (release candidate) Date

I had a talk with some interested MintCoin folks, and decided that we
need a deadline to focus the mind and get things going.

**MintCoin will have a 2.1 release candidate on 2018-09-01.**

# Packaging a Windows Installer

The main work for the release remains - as it has for some time now -
packaging the software. I noticed a file called
[`setup.nsi`](https://github.com/MintcoinCommunity/Mintcoin-Desktop-Wallet/blob/2.0/share/setup.nsi)
in the `share` directory of the source, and am pretty sure that this
is a configuration file for the 
[Nullsoft Scriptable Install System (NSIS)](http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Main_Page).
Using this we should be able to build a Windows installer from our
Travis CI setup, which has been our biggest hurdle for a while.

Let's hope so, since we have just over 3 weeks to get this working!

The plan is to release both a "normal" and "snapshotted" binary, one
with just executables and one with a snapshot included. This will be
done for:

* Linux 32-bit
* Linux 64-bit
* macOS 64-bit
* Windows 32-bit
* Windows 64-bit

Ideally we will have nice installers (`SETUP.EXE` for Windows, a `dmg`
file for macOS, and a tarball for Linux), but in the worst case we can
just ship a `ZIP` file for every system.

# Administrated

I have gotten owner access to the MintcoinCommunity GitHub
organization! This means that I can do a few more administration
tasks, such as adding additional reviewers if there are people in the
community willing to take on such work.

_Wishing you minty cool days,
