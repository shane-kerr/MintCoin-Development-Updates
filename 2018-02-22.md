# Mint Development Update 2018-02-22

Hello all!

We had yet another small bump in the price of MintCoin this week,
going from 10 satoshi to 12 satoshi. Sadly this did not help us answer
the most popular question on the MintCoin Telegram group, which is of
course: "when moon?"

Development was slow again this week, but not stopped. Lets look at
what happened....

# Windows Build

Enlil was able to put together a working Windows build. It is not
pretty, as it is cross-compiled and only builds on older versions of Ubuntu,
but it does seem to work. It is now available on:

[https://snapshot.mintcoin.zone](https://snapshot.mintcoin.zone)

It _should_ work on any version of Windows that Microsoft supports.

This is exciting because having a Windows build is of course essential
for any release. While no self-respecting hacker would ever be caught
dead with a Windows system, it turns out that many non-hackers find
Windows somehow. Even otherwise enlightened MintCoin users find
themselves on Windows systems. ðŸ˜‰

# ARM Build

By looking through various pieces of GitHub archaeology the needed
components for getting an ARM build fell into place, and we now have a
working MintCoin wallet on ARM!

This is very cool news because it leaves the possibility of setting up
a Raspberry Pi or some other low-powered, silent system that is always
on and not only holds your MintCoin but also handles minting new ones
for you.

Since a Raspberry Pi 3 with a micro SD card and power supply will
probably run â‚¬45 or so, this is a pretty significant investment just
for MintCoin... on the other hand, if you ask around you will probably
find a lot of your more geeky friends have a Raspberry Pi or two lying
in a drawer somewhere. Note that other single-board-computer (SBC)
running on ARM processors are available and some are even cheaper. See
what you can come up with!

Note that currently only the daemon version has been tested, but there
should be no reason that we cannot get the GUI version working soon.

We'll let this build run for a few days on a Raspberry Pi 3 and if it
seems stable then it will get merged into the main development branch,
and a binary for downloads will be published for testing.

# Minting Speedup Bug Fix

You may recall from the development update two weeks ago, 2018-02-09,
that we had a fix for a performance bug in the wallet.

It turns out that this fix actually broke the wallet when attempting
to synchronize from the first block on the blockchain. I had never
run it in this mode, but during the ARM testing this problem was
revealed. A simple fix was put in place, so we have working code
again, but this underscores the issues with lack of tests that we have
right now.

There are a few more important things to add than tests in the code
now, but it will probably be top priority after our next release.

# GitHub Issue Wrangling

Our intrepid Minty All Day closed a few of the issues on the main
MintCoin GitHub repository that had been sitting around idle for a
while.

On the unofficial side, there is now a slew of issues that have been
categorized:

[https://github.com/shane-kerr/Mintcoin-Desktop-Wallet/issues](https://github.com/shane-kerr/Mintcoin-Desktop-Wallet/issues)

These are now tagged so you can easily see which are bugs, which are
suggestions, and so on. A ton of these are labeled "help wanted", 
which means that if you or anyone you know is able to help it would be 
much appreciated. A couple are even labeled "good first issue", as 
they do not require much deep knowledge of the code base and anyone 
who can code in C++ should be able to jump right in.

# A Home for MintCoin Development 

We have started to collect a lot of fixes and improvements to
MintCoin, and each of these is nicely stored on a separate branch.
However, it has started to become a lot of branches, so I have pulled
these together into a single place:

[https://github.com/shane-kerr/Mintcoin-Desktop-Wallet](https://github.com/shane-kerr/Mintcoin-Desktop-Wallet)

Building from here will always result in what I think is the best
version of MintCoin possible at any given time.

Also, the `README.md` that you see in MintCoin's GitHub page is crusty
and old. An updated version has been authored, which is also used on
the combined repository. It also includes some revised links as well
as an updated mini-FAQ. (I may have to add "when moon?", and maybe
"when will MintCoin be on more exchanges?!?!", but I think it is okay
for now.)

# Goal Recap

As has become custom in these updates, here is a look at our current
goals.

The main focus now is getting a new version of the wallet that we can
publish which contains updated builds and all of the fixes that we
can. In order for that to happen, we need:

* A macOS wallet build
* Merging the changes upstream (or forking the repository)

Things that would be nice:

* A continuous integration (CI) environment
* Updated DNS peer discovery
* Speeding up the initial sync
* Packages for popular distributions (like Debian and Fedora packages)

Things that should be done someday:

* Wallet code automated testing
* Reducing the memory footprint

As always, if you would like to help, please either contact us or just
fork the code on GitHub and start hacking.

Until next update, remember: _if it ain't Mint, it ain't much._

_Your Minty Pal,
Shane Kerr_
