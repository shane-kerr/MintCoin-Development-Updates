# MintCoin Development Update 2018-04-20

Happy [4/20](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/420_(cannabis_culture))
everyone! Regardless of whether appreciate the leaves celebrated on
this day, I'm glad that you're interested in the leafy green goodness of
MintCoin.

The crypto markets were also a bit higher this week, with the first
sustained recovery in quite a while. The price of MintCoin itself
seems pretty stable, but who knows what the future brings?

# Code Changes 

The focus remains on getting a new release out. But as usual, I was
unable to resist making a few small changes to the wallet.

* Change to date format in logs  
  The MintCoin logs used a timestamp format which used the localized
  format for the date, but a 24-hour value for time. One problem with
  this is that it is impossible to know if 2/7/18 is February 7 or
  July 2, since the USA uses a broken date format, and without context
  it is impossible to know which was used. The simple solution for
  this is to use the
  [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) date format,
  which is `YYYY-mm-dd`. We also took the opportunity to explicitly
  note that times in the logs are in UTC, which was also not clear
  from the previous format.

* Minor cleanup of translation files  
  The translation files had a broken tag in them. This did not serve
  any purpose, but did cause warning messages when building the
  wallet. The broken tag has been removed from both of the supported
  languages (Russian and English).

# MintCoin on the Raspberry Pi - Yet Another Attempt

Rebelway518 on the MintCoin Telegram group decided to see if it is
possible to get MintCoin running on a Raspberry Pi. We have tried this
in the past, but always been stymied by the lack of memory; MintCoin
currently takes almost 2 Gbyte of RAM, and the humble Raspberry Pi
only has 1 Gbyte.

However, there is some chance that using a compressed RAM swap space
we can perhaps expand the available memory that MintCoin has
available to it. One way to do this on Raspbian is with
[zram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zram). Experiments are ongoing!

# Windows Problems

Some users are reporting various scary Windows error messages that are
preventing them from running the MintCoin wallet. We have some
theories about why this is happening - such as the memory size of
MintCoin growing to be too big for the 32-bit Windows wallet, or
perhaps some change pushed out by Microsoft recently - but we do not
really know. Maybe the new, 64-bit Windows wallet will help the
situation? Maybe Microsoft will push a fix for some broken underlying
system?

# Release Status: the 中文 Edition

We _still_ have a release plan for the next release, which we are
imaginatively calling "2.1-beta1" for now. The Etherpad with the plan
is here:

https://public.etherpad-mozilla.org/p/MintCoin-2.1-release-planning

At one point in the past week, some intrepid person translated about
half of the release plan to Chinese. You can see that here:

https://public.etherpad-mozilla.org/p/MintCoin-2.1-release-planning/timeslider#1608

While we don't mind anyone using the release plan for whatever they
want - including translating it to other languages - please don't
modify the release plan without chatting to people involved in the
release! You can _copy_ the release plan anywhere you want of course.
I chose a tool that is easy to use instead of requiring accounts or
approvals or something like that. It would be great if we could
continue to use it. 

As far as actual work since the last update, we have added build
support in Travis CI for Windows, both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of
both the command-line daemon and the Qt GUI wallet. Now we are
building for:

* Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (Trusty Tahr)
* OS X 10.11 (El Capitan)
* macOS 10.12 (Sierra)
* macOS 10.13 (High Sierra)
* Windows

You can always look at the current state of the Travis CI for MintCoin
here: 

https://travis-ci.org/MintcoinCommunity/Mintcoin-Desktop-Wallet

I _thought_ that this would be the last platform that we need, but
someone requested that we support 32-bit Linux. Once that is added our
set of targets will be complete.

That means that we still have two major things left to do before the
beta:

* Add 32-bit Linux support to the Travis CI builds  
  This should be possible with something called
  [multiarch](https://wiki.debian.org/Multiarch); a system where Linux
  can include libraries for more than one CPU family at a time. Using
  multiarch we should be able to build for both i686 (32-bit) and
  x86_64 (64-bit) CPU on Travis CI. (Note that we _might_ also be able
  to build for ARM CPU in this way too, but since the Raspberry Pi
  does not currently seem to be a valid system to run MintCoin on, I
  do not want to hold up the release for this.)

* Export the results of the Travis CI build  
  This means taking the compiled programs and sending them somewhere
  useful. It looks like this is straightforward, but the work has to
  be done.

# GitHub Repository Status

The official GitHub repository remains:

[https://github.com/MintcoinCommunity/Mintcoin-Desktop-Wallet](https://github.com/MintcoinCommunity/Mintcoin-Desktop-Wallet)

No issues were closed in the official repository.

One issue was added:

* [Research MXE compile warning about IPC](https://github.com/MintcoinCommunity/Mintcoin-Desktop-Wallet/issues/62)  
  There is a compiler warning when we cross-compile our Windows
  wallet. It is probably not super important, but we should
  investigate to be sure.

# Goal Recap

While the main focus is on the next release, there are also other
goals, such as:

* Figuring out the problem some Windows users are having
* Speeding up the initial sync
* Packages for popular distributions (like Debian and Fedora packages)
* Wallet code automated testing
* Reducing the memory footprint

I think we are all itching for even more exciting changes in MintCoin.
This should all be possible once we get our house in order with some
fixes to the old wallet.

As always, please contact us if you want to help, or just fork the
code on GitHub and start hacking.

Until next time, I am...
