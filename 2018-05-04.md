# MintCoin Development Update 2018-05-04

Hello everyone! It was
[Dodenherdenking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembrance_of_the_Dead)
today here in Holland. We remembered the end of World War II with two
minutes of silence. Let us all hope that the current wars and
conflicts going on around the world today come to an end as quickly as
possible, and that soon the only invasions will be new crypo
currencies taking over the world.

On a happier note, it is also
[Star Wars Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_Day)! May the
Fourth be with MintCoin.

# Ciao MintCoin!

We got our first submission of a new translation of the MintCoin
menus from [pEteRbAn](http://maxpetri.com). He is going through the Qt
localization for the coin and providing an Italian version. With luck
we'll have Italian support for the MintCoin wallet in the next
release.

# MintCoin Project Continuity

One issue that I have struggled with since starting on MintCoin a few
months ago is making sure we have project continuity, independent of
any one individual. I believe that the project should try to make sure
that it is always possible for someone new to pick up the work and add
useful or fun things to it, even if other people may leave the
project.

Using GitHub for the code is a good start for this. It is free, and is
publicly available to anyone. Coders can make changes to the code and
submit them using workflows that are familiar to most people working on
open source code these days.

Having Travis CI build and test carries this on further, since it sits
on top of GitHub and is also free and open. Today we build for almost
all of our target platforms on Travis CI, and the results of that are
visible for anyone interested.

Over the last couple weeks I have extended the Travis CI to publish
the results of the builds to MEGA.nz. Like GitHub and Travis CI, MEGA
is free, and runs on servers maintained by a company without any work
needed by anyone in the MintCoin community. It provides ability to
allow only users with the password to upload files, but also publish
them in a way that anyone can read it, for example a recent build went
here:

https://mega.nz/#F!nLZiTaDR!xTSt65WWAYH-78My09WJrw

It is easy to update the Travis CI to publish to a different MEGA
account if this one is lost, or even to publish somewhere else like
Amazon S3, Google Drive, or many other similar services.

On the development side we are starting to get a reasonable set of
tools that can keep MintCoin alive no matter what happens to any one
member of the development team.

However, there are a few things missing:

* We do not have administrator access to the GitHub MintCoin account.
  This means that we cannot add or remove users. None of the existing
  administrators has replied to requests for this.

* The social media situation is a bit of a mess. The owner of the most
  popular Twitter account does not actively participate in the project
  any more (please use
  [`@MintCoin_`](https://mega.nz/#F!nLZiTaDR!xTSt65WWAYH-78My09WJrw),
  which is run by an active participant). Nobody knows the owner of
  the Facebook page, although he has declared himself the CEO of
  MintCoin.
  
* The web site is not actively maintained, and there are at least 3 of
  these that a new user may consider the "real" MintCoin site.

Everything can be fixed, and I think that we can be a community coin
that also has enough tools and structure to make it run effectively.
The goal should be to make sure that we everyone can help in their own
way, while the project is able to continue even as people move on to
other endeavors.

# Working with Other Coins

I saw that [Bitcoin Green](https://www.savebitcoin.io/) was added to
Cryptopia, and their goals seem similar to MintCoin. I was thinking
maybe we could work together, and possibly even merge the coins at
some point.

More recently I was approached by some folks from [Social Send
Coin](https://socialsend.io/) who are interested in doing some
collaborative work, I think mostly in the area of marketing.

I tend to think that we can work with other coin communities to make
all coins stronger, as long as we have similar goals and technologies.
If you are interested in this - or hate the idea - please speak up.

# Code Changes

The only code change since the last update - except for our new
translation - was getting the wallet to send the output of the build
to a site so we can build our release packages, as mentioned in the
discussion on continuity above.

# Release Status

Since the last update, we have manged to push changes from all builds
to the MEGA site so we can build release packages.

The release will be "2.1-beta1".  The Etherpad with the plan is here:

https://public.etherpad-mozilla.org/p/MintCoin-2.1-release-planning

You can always look at the current state of the Travis CI for MintCoin
here: 

https://travis-ci.org/MintcoinCommunity/Mintcoin-Desktop-Wallet

For the release, we have two pieces of work (yes we said that last
week, but this time for sure):

* Add 32-bit Linux support to the Travis CI builds  
  This should be possible with something called
  [multiarch](https://wiki.debian.org/Multiarch); a system where Linux
  can include libraries for more than one CPU family at a time. Using
  multiarch we should be able to build for both i686 (32-bit) and
  x86_64 (64-bit) CPU on Travis CI.

* Build the packages for release
  For Windows we actually have MSI files, which should let us make an
  installers. Likewise for macOS we have some stuff to put into a DMG
  file which may provide an installer for Apple systems too. Finally,
  we need to include a snapshot in our release packages.

# GitHub Repository Status

The official GitHub repository remains:

[https://github.com/MintcoinCommunity/Mintcoin-Desktop-Wallet](https://github.com/MintcoinCommunity/Mintcoin-Desktop-Wallet)

No issues were closed in the official repository. We added one issue:

* [Always create MintCoin.conf on startup](https://github.com/MintcoinCommunity/Mintcoin-Desktop-Wallet/issues/65)  
  We should make sure that we always make a configuration file when
  the MintCoin wallet starts, if none is present yet. This will make
  it easier for users to customize their setup if needed.

# Goal Recap

While the main focus is on the next release, there are also other
goals, such as:

* Speeding up the initial sync
* Packages for popular distributions (like Debian and Fedora packages)
* Wallet code automated testing
* Reducing the memory footprint
* Investigating mobile wallets

_I've got a good feeling about this,
