# MintCoin Development Update 2018-04-13

Happy Friday the 13th, MintCoin followers!

Hopefully none of us suffers from
[paraskevidekatriaphobia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friday_the_13th#History)
on this lovely Friday. Trust in the crypto; everything will turn out
fine in the end.

We all breathed a minty-fresh sigh of relief this week as Cryptopia's
MintCoin wallet finally finished syncing and deposits and withdrawls
with our biggest exchange once again became possible. It turns out
that their wallet had become stuck for some reason, and they needed to
re-sync. Their policy is not to use blockchain snapshots, so it took
quite a while. But with some patience it all worked out - and we have
a much better communication channel with Cryptopia for any future
problems.

# Code Changes 

The focus of the work has been getting a new release out, but I
decided to spend some time working on a couple of older issues that
seemed like "low-hanging fruit"... that is, bugs or small improvements
that would be relatively easy yet provide some nice changes. I also
thought it might be nice to close some issues!

## How Long Until I Can MINT!??!?!

The first set of changes were suggested by Zohaib via Telegram. The
idea was to let the user know how long it would be until they would
have coins that are 20 days old, and so available for minting again.

After noticing that the tooltip gives you an estimate of how long it
will be until you mint a new coin after you have mature coins, it
seemed like a pretty good idea to provide similar information for the
coins that were not yet mature. So we let you know when the next coin
will mature in the tool tip. Here's a screenshot:

![Tooltip indicating time until a coin matures](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1943584/38581536-b02d6eea-3cfc-11e8-8232-44e45921d4e7.png
"Tooltip indicating time until a coin matures")

To provide similar information to anyone using the daemon version, the
`listunspent` command was updated to provide information about the
transaction time for each coin that you have which can be minted. A
user can then figure out when each coin will be mature. So it provides
more information, but also requires a bit more work - exactly how it
should be for the RPC interface.

The output looks something like this:

```json
{
  "txid" : "6ebc4b46fc126dc40665ca8a2feac3765ff8aac5ddd454d7f23b88d4047945ce",
  "vout" : 2,
  "scriptPubKey" : "210361e4ae8e1204d435b4335a67c6ac0f4c45cd91d9019cfb6cf7090ab102a8e486ac",
  "amount" : 10028.96835600,
  "confirmations" : 15936,
  "txtime" : "2018-04-07T06:01:34Z",
  "txtimereceived" : "2018-04-07T06:01:38Z"
  },
  {
  "txid" : "729dac41dccc51a882c025b7c05463e79a9725916749f7a9871c3e747f7406d6",
  "vout" : 1,
  "scriptPubKey" : "21020022e9b5bd305fb466016f52122dd8009bc1542f4447ab8307fe574c4e349bbeac",
  "amount" : 65973.84000000,
  "confirmations" : 59726,
  "txtime" : "2018-03-22T21:57:41Z",
  "txtimereceived" : "2018-03-22T21:57:44Z"
  },
```

You can see the `txtime` and `txtimereceived` values are present for
every unspent coin.

## Command-Line Paper Cuts

There were three "paper cuts" fixed; these are things that do not
cause any major problem but are a bit annoying. These are really only
to people running the code from a command line, but should have been
fixed in any case.

1. When starting the GUI wallet there were warnings about the RGP
   profile. This came from problems with the image files. Enlil fixed
   those issues.
2. Also when starting the GUI wallet there were warnings about the Qt
   style sheet. There were a couple of bugs in the code which luckily
   only caused warnings.
3. Finally, when starting the daemon from Linux, it would run in the
   background before announcing that it was starting, causing a
   somewhat untidy console output.

# Release Status

We have a release plan for the next release, which we are
imaginatively calling "2.1-beta1" for now. The Etherpad with the plan
is here:

https://public.etherpad-mozilla.org/p/MintCoin-2.1-release-planning

Since the last update, the [continuous
integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration)
that MintCoin uses - Travis CI - has been extended. We now build the
MintCoin wallet for:

* Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (Trusty Tahr)
* OS X 10.11 (El Capitan)
* macOS 10.12 (Sierra)
* macOS 10.13 (High Sierra)

We build the daemon wallet, including both a dynamially-linked and
statically-linked version, and the GUI, Qt-based wallet for every
system. (A build of the daemon is also built for OS X 10.10
(Yosemite), but Qt is no longer supported on it so no GUI version is
available.)

You can always look at the current state of the Travis CI for MintCoin
here: 

https://travis-ci.org/MintcoinCommunity/Mintcoin-Desktop-Wallet

We have two major things left to do before the beta:

* Integrate the Windows builds into our Travis CI setup  
  Right now we know how to cross-build for Windows, and we know how to
  use Travis CI, but we have not yet combined the two.

* Export the results of the Travis CI build  
  We are already compiling programs that we can run, but we just throw
  the results away. Since we have them, we just need to send them
  someplace more permanent.

Once all of this prepatory work is done, we will be able to make a
release. The good news is that future releases will be able to ship
much faster, since all of the infrastructure will generate all of the
runnable wallet code with every change.

# GitHub Repository Status

The official GitHub repository remains:

[https://github.com/MintcoinCommunity/Mintcoin-Desktop-Wallet](https://github.com/MintcoinCommunity/Mintcoin-Desktop-Wallet)

We closed one issue in the official repository:

* [Build static versions of wallet](https://github.com/MintcoinCommunity/Mintcoin-Desktop-Wallet/issues/40)  

We also closed some issues from my personal repository, which is where
issues were recorded before we got access to the official repository:

* [Give indication of how long until coins can be minted](https://github.com/shane-kerr/Mintcoin-Desktop-Wallet/issues/8)
* [Look at warnings on Qt wallet start](https://github.com/shane-kerr/Mintcoin-Desktop-Wallet/issues/20)

No new issues were added!

# Goal Recap

While the main focus is on the next release, there are also other
goals, such as:

* Speeding up the initial sync
* Packages for popular distributions (like Debian and Fedora packages)
* Wallet code automated testing
* Reducing the memory footprint

I think we are all itching for even more exciting changes in MintCoin.
This should all be possible once we get our house in order with some
fixes to the old wallet.

As always, please contact us if you want to help, or just fork the
code on GitHub and start hacking.

Until next time, as always, I am...

_Mintily Yours,  
Shane Kerr_
