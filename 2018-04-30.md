# MintCoin Development Update 2018-04-30

Welcome to the
[E-mail Debt Forgiveness Day](update://email.gimletmedia.com/) edition
of the MintCoin Development Update. In that spirit, your humble author
hopes that you will forgive this late development update.

It was definitely a quiet week for MintCoin, with
[King's Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koningsdag) and other
things distracting our developers, who all seem to live in Holland.

# Windows Startup Problems: Workaround Delivered

In the last update we reported that there were some error messages
related to problems for users of the Windows wallet. In an awesome
feat of debugging, Rebelway518 discovered that for some reason
disabling the splash screen fixes the problem. Here's the workaround:

> Make a shortcut to `Mintcoin-Qt.exe`. Right click on the
> shortcut-&gt;Properties. Then add `-splash=0` to the end of the
> target string. That way you'll only need to double click the
> shortcut in the future.

Thanks to Rebelway518 for sticking with it! We'll see if this is
still necessary on the wallet when we get a new version out, and if so
we'll try to get an actual fix.

# Code Changes 

Due to other committments, no code changes were made since the last
update.

# Release Status

Since the last update, we have manged to push changes from the Linux
and Windows builds to a site where they can be used to build release
packages. The macOS builds resist this, but should hopefully be
working soon.

The release will be "2.1-beta1".  The Etherpad with the plan is here:

https://public.etherpad-mozilla.org/p/MintCoin-2.1-release-planning

You can always look at the current state of the Travis CI for MintCoin
here: 

https://travis-ci.org/MintcoinCommunity/Mintcoin-Desktop-Wallet

That means that we still have two major things left to do before the
beta:

* Add 32-bit Linux support to the Travis CI builds  
  This should be possible with something called
  [multiarch](https://wiki.debian.org/Multiarch); a system where Linux
  can include libraries for more than one CPU family at a time. Using
  multiarch we should be able to build for both i686 (32-bit) and
  x86_64 (64-bit) CPU on Travis CI.

* Export the results of the Travis CI build for macOS
  Exports of everything but macOS are working, so once this is done we
  will have all of our binaries in a place that we can easily
  distribute and test from.

# GitHub Repository Status

The official GitHub repository remains:

[https://github.com/MintcoinCommunity/Mintcoin-Desktop-Wallet](https://github.com/MintcoinCommunity/Mintcoin-Desktop-Wallet)

No issues were added or closed in the official repository.

# Goal Recap

While the main focus is on the next release, there are also other
goals, such as:

* Speeding up the initial sync
* Packages for popular distributions (like Debian and Fedora packages)
* Wallet code automated testing
* Reducing the memory footprint

Apologies again for the late update as well as the slow progress.
Patience dear MintCoin fans!
