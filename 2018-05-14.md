# MintCoin Development Update 2018-05-14

Bonjour MintCoin followers!

We didn't have a lot of progress on the MintCoin front since the last
update, and your intrepid developer has just arrived in Marseilles. I
will be busy with the [RIPE meeting](https://ripe76.ripe.net) there
(making the Internet better) instead of working on MintCoin (making
crypto currency better). So, this will be the last update for a couple
of weeks, when we hope to have lots of progress to report.

# Additional Blockchain Snapshot

Our usual source of MintCoin blockchain snapshots,
https://snapshot.mintcoin.zone, was down for some time and the
maintainer away temporarily. Making another snapshot was not
difficult, but finding a place to host it was trickier.

I wanted a place that was free (because I am cheap, and also because I
wanted a place that anyone else could easily set up). I needed
something like 10 Gbyte of storage, because we want to be able to
upload a new version of the snapshot at the same time people are
downloading the old one, and this won't fit in 5 Gbyte. I also want
basically unlimited transfers, since it does not take very many people
downloading a snapshot to use a lot of transfer bandwidth.

People suggested Google Drive, which would probably be fine. But I am
already using my Google storage for other things, and didn't really
feel like dealing with the hassle of getting a second Google account
for this purpose.

I ended up using [hubiC](https://hubic.com) for this purpose. It
offers 25 Gbyte of free storage, which is enough, and I could not find
any mention of a transfer cap. It is a bit slow, so I am willing to
consider other suggestions for a hosting site, but it does work.

You can download the current snapshot here:

My plan is to make weekly snapshots, and use a redirect link which
always points to the latest version. This should provide some
redundancy - having two snapshots should allow us to bootstrap the
MintCoin wallet reliably until we get a new wallet out which includes
one.

# Donations

I got two donations of MintCoin, one from an individual and one from
MintyAllDay's MintCoin development fund. Thank you all!

My current plan is to think about setting up a more organized way for
people to donate, but I really want to wait until a new version of the
wallet is out first. Basically, I feel like until that is delivered no
real benefits have been delivered to users so it does not make too
much sense.

# Code Changes

There have been no new code changes since the last update, although
the Italian translation was updated. It is not yet merged into the
main branch, but will be as soon as the translator decides that it is
good enough.

# Release Status

There has not been any progress on the next release since the last
update.

# GitHub Repository Status

The official GitHub repository remains:

[https://github.com/MintcoinCommunity/Mintcoin-Desktop-Wallet](https://github.com/MintcoinCommunity/Mintcoin-Desktop-Wallet)

No issues were closed or added in the official repository.

# Goal Recap

While the main focus is on the next release, there are also other
goals, such as:

* Speeding up the initial sync
* Packages for popular distributions (like Debian and Fedora packages)
* Wallet code automated testing
* Reducing the memory footprint
* Investigating mobile wallets
