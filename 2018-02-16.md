# Mint Development Update 2018-02-16

Hello Mighty Minters!

The price of MintCoin rose this week, with the long-standing 7 satoshi
wall finally giving way and seemingly arriving at a comfortable new
10 satoshi wall. This of course makes us all happy, but you can follow
market changes anywhere! What we really want is to dig into the
details of the MintCoin technologies, right?

This week saw our intrepid MintCoin developer sick for a few days.
Luckily this was not enough to prevent all progress being made on the
wallet and other MintCoin technologies.

# Capitalizing MintCoin

_What's in a name? That which we call a mint  
By any other word would smell as minty fresh;_  
    - William Shakespeare if he was alive today, probably

While working on the coin it occurred to me that I saw MintCoin being
called both "Mintcoin" and "MintCoin". After a short discussion Minty
All Day mentioned that he preferred "mintcoin". In true democratic
fashion, he put up a Twitter poll and let the Internet decide:

The results are clear: MintCoin (capital 'M', capital 'C') received
73% of the votes.

From this day forward, we will use **MintCoin** as the official
capitalization for MintCoin.

# Fix for Assertion Failure on Exit

The wallet was exiting with an assertion failure on shutdown:

```
mintcoind: /usr/include/boost/thread/pthread/recursive_mutex.hpp:113: void boost::recursive_mutex::lock(): Assertion `!pthread_mutex_lock(&m)' failed.
```

An
[assertion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assertion_(software_development))
is a check that software developers sometimes add to programs to
prevent them from doing something unexpected. If a user encounters
them then it is a bug.

In this case, probably nothing was done for a long time because this
happened when the program was shutting down so did not seem to cause
any harm. I decided that any assertion failure is a cause for worry,
and dug into the problem. You can follow the debugging here if you are
curious for the details:

[https://github.com/shane-kerr/Mintcoin-Desktop-Wallet/issues/6](https://github.com/shane-kerr/Mintcoin-Desktop-Wallet/issues/6)

The end result is that the wallet was temporarily forgetting about
threads trying to connect to other nodes - on purpose - to allow the
wallet to exit faster. Unfortunately this also ended up corrupting
memory!

It is possible that this could have far worse impact than just a scary
message, so I added a fix. The drawback is that the wallet can take up
to 5 seconds to shutdown - a small price to pay to avoid running
through invalid memory.

# Pushing Fixes Upstream 

I started the process of getting the fixes and other changes that I
have been working on pushed upstream, into the official MintCoin
repository on GitHub. Minty All Day is the gatekeeper, and has been
cautious about merging changes without proper review. Right now that
seems to be the limiting factor on getting new code into the MintCoin
wallet.

If you can read C++ code, please contact Minty All Day or me (Shane
Kerr) and we can figure out how to get a proper review.

# Security Audit

I was approached by a couple of people who have done work with
security audits of code. They said they would be willing to provide
such an audit for the MintCoin codebase, which would be awesome. Keep
your fingers crossed, and stay tuned!

# Goal Recap

The main focus now is getting a new version of the wallet that we can
publish which contains updated builds and all of the fixes that we
can. In order for that to happen, we need:

* Updated documentation
* A Windows wallet build
* A macOS wallet build
* Merging the changes upstream (or forking the repository)

Things that would be nice:

* ARM wallet build (for example, for Raspberry Pi)
* A continuous integration (CI) environment
* Updated DNS peer discovery
* Speeding up the initial sync

Things that should be done someday:

* Wallet code automated testing
* Reducing the memory footprint

As always, if you would like to help, please either contact us or just
fork the code on GitHub and start hacking.

Until next update, stay minty fresh!
