# Mint Development Update 2018-03-30

Hello again, followers of MintCoin!

As explained in the last update, I was away for a while, and did not
have much time for Mintcoin. So this will be a light update, but
hopefully still interesting.

In spite of there being not much _development_ activity, there has
been a lot of other activity in the MintCoin world.

One thing that everybody reading this will surely know is that the
crypto currency market has been crashing pretty hard. The current
market cap as reported by CoinMarketCap is just over 250 billion US
dollars, which is about one third of the heady heights of early
January 2018. MintCoin itself has also gone down in value quite a bit,
also about one third of its recent value versus Bitcoin. Rumors abound
about pump and dump schemes, whales manipulating the prices, and so
on. We all hope that the underlying utility of crypto currencies and
MintCoin in particular will turn this around.

Another non-development activity is nearly non-stop drama that has
occurred in the MintCoinOfficial Telegram group. Various individuals
and groups have spent a lot of time and energy being upset with each
other. It certainly did not feel very minty for several weeks. Things
have been quieter for the last few days, so hopefully we have passed
through the storm of community unrest... and are not just in the eye
of the hurricane.

That's more than enough doom and gloom for one update though. Lets
talk about the recent technical developments!

# Code Changes 

We've only had two changes merged since the last update:

1. ARM build support has been merged into the main repository  
   While you need an ARM machine with 2 GB or more of RAM to run the
   wallet right now, it is possible and "officially" supported now,
   right out of the main source.

2. Error fix from static code analysis  
   I ran [`cppcheck`](http://cppcheck.sourceforge.net/) against the
   MintCoin wallet source. This is a type of program that looks at
   source code and searches for common errors. It only found one
   possibly serious error, which has been fixed. A lot of warnings
   were found, which should be fixed, but these are less critical and
   have a lower priority.

# Telegram Access to MintCoin Wallet

Our ever-productive Enlil has been working on a way to access your
MintCoin wallet from a mobile device, and has built a Telegram bot
that you can link up to your wallet. We are excited to see this kind
of innovation, and look forward to seeing where it goes in the future.

Source code, and an explaination of how it works, is available here:

https://github.com/nexus166/walletbotd

# GitHub Repository Status

The official GitHub repository remains:

[https://github.com/MintcoinCommunity/Mintcoin-Desktop-Wallet](https://github.com/MintcoinCommunity/Mintcoin-Desktop-Wallet)

We added one new issue:

* [Investigate reproducible builds of the wallet](https://github.com/MintcoinCommunity/Mintcoin-Desktop-Wallet/issues/46)  
  Something we will want to look at in the future is a way that we can
  make sure that the code that you run can be verified to be correct.
  This will prevent unscrupulous individuals from trying to get you to
  run a trojan program which may steal your precious MintCoins or
  worse!

# Goal Recap

Our main goals now are still:

* A 64-bit Windows wallet build
* A macOS wallet build

We have actually made progress on the 64-bit Windows wallet, now being
able to easily build both a 32-bit and 64-bit command-line Windows
wallet from Linux. The graphical Qt wallet is still not quite there,
but should not be too much longer before it is ready for testing.

On the macOS side, Enlil has found a way to run a macOS virtual
machine without requiring an Apple computer. With that in place, we
should be able to get a macOS wallet built, hopefully over the weekend
but if not then surely early next week.

Our list of things that would be nice remains:

* Speeding up the initial sync
* Packages for popular distributions (like Debian and Fedora packages)

And our list of things that should be done someday also remains:

* Wallet code automated testing
* Reducing the memory footprint

Please contact us if you want to help, or just fork the code on GitHub
and start hacking.

# Have a Minty Easter

If you live in a place that celebrates Easter, then have a great
Easter weekend! If you don't then have a great weekend anyway. It may
be the only time you can safely eat mint-colored eggs, so savor the
special time of year.

_Mint in peace and love,
